# Paymet
Paymet is an automative service for selling ``Roblox`` in-game items for ``Robux`` without any user interactions.

This project was something that I wanted to work on during the summer before I start college. As of writing this , this is the last weekend before college starts and I wouldn't want to waste my time on working this project. I wouldn't recommend using this project as it is unfinished ,  having a lot of bugs , and being rushed towards the end. 

Use this project as a learning guide for those who want to be upcoming devs.
